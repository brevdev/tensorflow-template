This is the template we use to setup the Brev Tensorflow template. 

If you want to use it on your own machine, run

```
./.brev/setup.sh
```
Then either open the notebook or main.py file (both train an MNIST model).
```
python mnist_classifier/main.py
```
If you want to run the pre-configured Brev environment go to this link

N.B. At Brev, we are working really hard to make great templates to help people get started with ML easily. We think one of the biggest difficulties in getting started with ML is to setup models and environments. So we make templates that just work out of the box. If you want a template for a specific framework/model, let us know in our [discord](https://discord.gg/NVDyv7TUgJ) and weâ€™ll make it.
