At Brev, we are really going hard on templates at the moment. We think one of the biggest difficulties in getting started with ML is to setup models and environments. So we make templates that just work out of the box. If you want a template for a specific framework/model, let us know in our [discord](https://discord.gg/NVDyv7TUgJ) and weâ€™ll make it.
